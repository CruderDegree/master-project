This file is supposed to help me remember what 
the different datafiles from QEngine runs where about

composerReplication.json
Seed was sin(2*pi*t/T)
3 iterations of noisy seeds w. noise betw. 0.5,-0.5
gamma was not used, will probably use it next time
All 3 optimizers were used, Nsteps capped at 3000
runtime ~ 21171 s

composerReplication-2.json
Seed 0.5 sin ( 4 * pi * t/T)
10 iterations, noise was pm 0.4
gamma 0
Only Grape, Ncap = 3000
runtime = 16840 s

composerReplication-3.json
Seed sin ( pi * t/T)
10 iterations, noise was pm 0.7
gamma 0
Only Grape, Ncap = 3000
runtime = 19574 s

composerReplication-4.json
Seed 0.33*cos(2* PI * ts / duration) + 0.20 * cos(3 * PI * ts / duration)
T = 0.125 to 1.125 (33 steps)
10 iterations, noise was pm 0.4
gamma 1e-6 - remember to add it to ctrl problem
All 3 optimzers, Ncap = 3000
runtime = 119326 s

composerReplication-2-redone.json
using same srandseed as composerReplication-2
Seed 0.5 sin ( 4 * pi * t/T)
t was 0.125 -- 0.8125
10 iterations, noise was pm 0.4
gamma 1e-5
sigma 2e3, bounds were pm 2
Only Grape, Ncap = 3000
runtime = 18193 s

composerReplication-redone.json
using same srandseed as composerReplication
Seed sin ( 2 * pi * t/T)
t was 0.125 -- 0.8125
5 iterations, noise was pm 0.4
gamma 1e-5
sigma 2e3, bounds were pm 2
All optimizers, Ncap = 3000
runtime = 20581 s
