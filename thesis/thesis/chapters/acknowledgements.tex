\chapter*{Preface}

This project was written with 3\textsuperscript{rd} year Bsc physics students in mind. Before starting this project, I have had a 5 ECTS numerical programming course in MATLAB 2 years prior. Parallel to this project, I took a 10 ECTS introductory programming course in Python, which is also the language the algorithm I worked on, ASLA, is written in. 

\chapter*{Acknowledgements}

I would like to thank my fellow student Frederik Fup Johansen, for assistance and good, technical discussions of this project. 

Thank you to my girlfriend, Andrea Mølgaard Nielsen, who has been of great source of support and assistance during the whole project.  

Finally, I would like to thank professor Bjørk Hammer, for the excellent guidance, for the exciting challenges, and for always having his door open to help during this project.
