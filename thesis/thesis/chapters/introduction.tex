\chapter{Introduction}

When searching for new materials or new pharmaceutical drugs with desired medical properties, machine learning (ML) is a method that can be used to predict promising candidates among many possibilities to test. One example includes training a network with extensive amounts of data, i. e. known drugs and their properties, enabling the network to predict new drug indications \cite{Dumontier2017}. 

Like with many other things in nature, mankind has let itself be inspired by the brain. This led to the development of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) in an attempt to model the processing capabilities of it \cite{Rojas96}. 

\section{Convolutional Neural Networks}

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are a type of ANN typically used in image processing \cite{WikiCNN}. CNNs are used for tasks such as labelling or predicting based on the image they are fed, used in e.g. facial recognition or for self-driving cars. The image is scanned by a kernel which output is passed through several hidden layers to an output layer, which can be anything from a single number to a vector to a matrix with the same dimensions as the input . A method called backpropagation is used to adjust the weights and biases of the hidden layers to improve the predictability of the CNN. \cite{WikiCNN}

\section{Reinforcement Learning}

Reinforcement Learning (RF) is an area of machine learning where a software agent attempts to maximize a reward based on the current state of some environment, choosing among a set of actions \cite{Wiki_RF}. This kind of system is called a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and the goal is for the agent to find the optimal balance between exploration of the enviroment and exploitation of known actions that result in high reward \cite{Wiki_RF}.

The power of reinforcement learning has been demonstrated by the Google DeepMind-team and their AlphaGo Zero program which, taking no prior knowledge, beat their other champion-defeating program AlphaGo 100-0 in the board game Go \cite{AlphaGo}. \\
